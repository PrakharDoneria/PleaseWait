# PleaseWait 

PleaseWait is a lightweight library that can be used as a drop-in replacement for now-deprecated `android.app.ProgressDialog`.
According to Google, the reason to deprecate the good old `ProgressDialog` is:
> ProgressDialog is a modal dialog, which prevents the user from interacting with the app. Instead of using this class, you should use a progress indicator like ProgressBar, which can be embedded in your app's UI.

I understand the reasoning but it means we have to do some more work to prevent the user from doing something unexpected before the operation is finished. Come on, using a progress dialog is so much easier. So I made this library to use in my apps to avoid those deprecation warnings everywhere and to improve the look of the progress dialog. Also I wanted to learn the process of publishing a library.

## How to use
1. Add the dependency to the app-level `build.gradle`. 

   <sup>Latest version:</sup> [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.tashilapathum/please-wait/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.tashilapathum/please-wait)
```gradle
implementation 'io.github.tashilapathum:please-wait:$latest_version'
```

2. Intitialize with `Activity` or `Fragment` context and show.
```kotlin
val progressDialog = PleaseWaitDialog(context = this)
progressDialog.show()
```

3. Optionally set title and message
```kotlin
progressDialog.setTitle("Please wait")
progressDialog.setMessage("Loading...")
```

4. Dismiss when the operation is complete
```
progressDialog.dismiss()
```


## Additional options

- Choose progress style: `CIRCULAR`, `LINEAR`, `BOTH` or `NONE`. Default is `CIRCULAR`
```kotlin
progressDialog.setProgressStyle(PleaseWaitDialog.ProgressStyle.LINEAR)
```

- Set determinate or indeterminate mode. Default is `true`.
```kotlin
progressDialog.setIndeterminate(false)
```

- Set progress. You can just set the progress and the progress bars will smoothly animate from indeterminate to determinate mode.
```kotlin
progressDialog.setProgress(20)
```

- Set title and message by overriding resources on `strings.xml`. Does not have a title or message by default. 
```xml
<string name="please_wait_dialog_default_title">Please wait</string>
<string name="please_wait_dialog_default_message">Loadingâ€¦</string>
```


## Java implementation
```java
PleaseWaitDialog progressDialog = new PleaseWaitDialog(this);
progressDialog.seTitle("Please wait");
progressDialog.setMessage("Loading...");
progressDialog.setCancelable(false);
progressDialog.show();
```
